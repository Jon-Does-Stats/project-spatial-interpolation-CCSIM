## Primary project objective
- Create a tool that ingests various spatial data types and enables users to easily compare common spatial interpolation methods, and different parameterizations of those methods. CCSIM: Comparing Common Spatial Interpolation Methods.

## Primary languages
- Python

## Highlighted visualizations
- (below) an interpolation of the three methods supported by the program.  Three different parameterizations for each are also illustrated.  Note each subplot has dynamically generated parameter labels and leave-one-out-cross-validation metrics. The original input data was a csv file of coordinate pairs.

- (below) an illustration of the program's raster functionality.  If supplied with a raster, the program will sample random points from the source and interpolate surfaces with those points.  The first subplot position is reserved for the "truth" image and metrics relevant to its composition.

- (below) an interpolation of the three methods supported by the program. The original input data was a .shp file.

- (below) Interpolated surfaces generated with a single method (kriging). A user can build a three by three plot grid of predictions generated by one, two, or all three supported methods.

- (below) A single interpolated surface of the truth raster using inverse-distance weighting. The truth image on the left again illustrates the enhanced raster functionality in the relevant information dynamically generated above and below the plot intself.
